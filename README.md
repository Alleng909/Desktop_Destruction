# Desktop_Destruction
(Actual one)
I tried implementing a template function to check range,
and a for_each lambda function to locate a certain pointer in an array.

To run the program, make a txt file named Load1 in the build-Desktop_Destruction folder and copy in the following text:
10 10 4
Weapon Name	Hits	Range	Max	Min	Accuracy
FirstWeapon	1	2	5	3	.8 
SecondWeapon	2	3	2	1	.5 
ThirdWeapon	3	2	2	1	.4 
Sniper		1	5	10	7	.9 

Icon Name	Hp	Dodge	Speed	xLoc	yLoc	Ownership
Ally1		99	.99	8	0	0	0
Ally2		10	.8	6	2	3	0
Enemy1		50	.3	4	8	9	1
Enemy2		20	.3	4	9	9	1
